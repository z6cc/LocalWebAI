- **WebAssembly Powered**: Leverage WASM for fast and efficient execution.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with both browsers and Node.js.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Load models in various formats, including GGUF and ONNX.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize GPU resources for enhanced performance.

## Installation

To get started with LocalWebAI, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/z6cc/LocalWebAI/releases). You will find the necessary files to download and execute.

### Browser Installation

1. Download the browser package from the releases.
2. Unzip the package.
3. Open the HTML file in your preferred browser.

### Node.js Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Download the Node.js package from the releases.
3. Unzip the package.
4. Run the following command in your terminal:

   npm install localwebai
   ```

## Usage

### Running in the Browser

After installation, you can start using LocalWebAI in your browser. Open the HTML file you downloaded, and follow these steps:

1. Load your model file (in GGUF or ONNX format).
2. Use the provided JavaScript functions to interact with the model.
3. Process inputs and retrieve outputs directly in your browser.

### Running in Node.js

To use LocalWebAI in a Node.js application, follow these steps:

1. Import the library in your JavaScript file:

   ```javascript
   const LocalWebAI = require('localwebai');
   ```

2. Load your model:

   ```javascript
   const model = LocalWebAI.loadModel('path/to/your/model.gguf');
   ```

3. Use the model to process inputs:

   ```javascript
   const output = model.predict('Your input text here');
   console.log(output);
   ```

## Supported Models

LocalWebAI supports various model formats, including:

- **GGUF**: A flexible format designed for AI models.
- **ONNX**: A popular open format for deep learning models.

You can easily convert models from other formats to GGUF or ONNX using available tools.

## Performance

LocalWebAI is designed for efficiency. With GPU acceleration, it can handle large models and datasets with ease. The use of WebAssembly ensures that the execution speed is optimized for both browsers and Node.js environments.

### Benchmarks

- **Inference Speed**: Achieve real-time inference speeds with optimized models.
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management allows you to run larger models without crashing.
